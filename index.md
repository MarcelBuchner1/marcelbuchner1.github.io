# Roland Deschain the last gunslinger


Roland Deschain, the last gunslinger from Mittwelt, 
is the central figure in the legend about the Dark Tower.

The son of Steven Deschain and his wife Gabrielle is the thirtieth descendant of a sideline descended from Arthur Eld, 
the mythical king of the world. Like the rest of the race, Roland is a warrior of the white.
He is looking for the Dark Tower, the linchpin of the space-time continuum. >_<
